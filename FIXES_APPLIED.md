# Fixes Applied - Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve the reported issues.

## Issue 1: Form Submission Error (RLS Policy)

### Problem
When submitting a form, users received this error:
```
Error creating submission: {
  code: '42501',
  message: 'new row violates row-level security policy for table "form_submissions"'
}
```

### Root Cause
The Row Level Security (RLS) policy on the `form_submissions` table was too restrictive and prevented anonymous users from submitting forms, even when the form was published.

### Solution
Created migration file: `supabase/migration-fix-form-submissions.sql`

**Changes:**
- Recreated RLS policies to allow anonymous submissions to published forms
- Maintained security by only allowing submissions when form is published
- Form owners can still view their submissions (requires authentication)

**To Apply:**
See instructions in `supabase/APPLY_FORM_SUBMISSION_FIX.md`

## Issue 2: Loading Shimmer Showing Everywhere

### Problem
The "RECRUITIFY" loading shimmer was appearing in all loading elements (stats cards, etc.) instead of just showing at the center of the page during page transitions.

### Root Cause
The `LoadingShimmer` component was being used incorrectly in the dashboard stats cards where simple skeleton loaders should be used instead.

### Solution
**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Replaced LoadingShimmer with proper skeleton loaders in stats cards
- `src/app/loading.tsx` - Created global loading component for page transitions

**Changes:**
1. Stats cards now use simple gray skeleton loaders (animate-pulse)
2. Page transitions show the centered "RECRUITIFY" shimmer
3. Better UX with appropriate loading states for different contexts

## Issue 3: Custom URL Slugs Not Working

### Problem
- Custom URL slugs weren't being saved or used
- Forms couldn't be accessed via custom slugs
- No toast notification when copying form URL

### Root Cause
- Database didn't have `custom_slug` column
- Form retrieval only checked by ID, not by slug
- Copy button didn't show feedback

### Solution
Created migration file: `supabase/migration-custom-slug.sql`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/database.ts` - Added custom_slug support to getForm and updateForm
- `src/components/form-builder/form-builder.tsx` - Save custom slug and use it in URLs
- `src/components/form-builder/form-settings-panel.tsx` - Added copy toast notification

**Changes:**
1. Added `custom_slug` column to forms table (unique, indexed)
2. Forms can now be accessed via `/forms/custom-slug` or `/forms/form-id`
3. Copy button shows "Form URL copied to clipboard!" toast
4. URL display shows actual form ID when available

**To Apply:**
See instructions in `supabase/APPLY_CUSTOM_SLUG_MIGRATION.md`

## Required Actions

### 1. Apply Database Migrations

You need to run TWO migrations in your Supabase dashboard:

#### Migration 1: Form Submissions Fix (CRITICAL - Do this first!)
```sql
-- Run the contents of: supabase/migration-fix-form-submissions.sql
```

#### Migration 2: Custom Slug Support
```sql
-- Run the contents of: supabase/migration-custom-slug.sql
```

### 2. Test the Fixes

After applying migrations:

1. **Test Form Submissions:**
   - Publish a form
   - Open it in incognito mode
   - Submit the form
   - Should succeed without errors

2. **Test Custom Slugs:**
   - Edit a form
   - Go to Settings tab
   - Set a custom slug (e.g., "my-form")
   - Save the form
   - Access it via `/forms/my-form`

3. **Test Loading States:**
   - Navigate between pages
   - Should see centered "RECRUITIFY" shimmer
   - Dashboard stats should show gray skeleton loaders

4. **Test Copy URL:**
   - Click copy button next to form URL
   - Should see toast: "Form URL copied to clipboard!"
